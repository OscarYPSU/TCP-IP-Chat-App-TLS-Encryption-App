Deployed and configured a Ubuntu server on AWS EC2 instance and put my server code in it using SSH from my local machines to access AWS instance.

Added server handling of mutiple client socket being connected to server using threading. Able to handle multiple messages at the same time
Challenges: had some issue about how the pointeres deferenceing and memory addres worked in c but looked up resources and pracrtices a bit on easier code. neede this skill for setting pthread in c
Chalenges: had trouble witht he server having a block somewhere int he code preventing from further process even though i was utilizing threading. Problemw as i was taking input as a server which waits until user has given input to server for server to resume operation. learned that SERVER should never directly take input and put a block on the code as a lot of threading and set up requires server to be ran at all times 

Added SSL enecryption oon top of TCP/IP protocl using openSSL lib. Now messages are encrypted and are guaranteed to arrive at the correct server(no middle man attack)
